## Evaluations

We have categorized our code by the experiments in our paper.

-	 ``heatmap/`` folder contained code needed to reproduce our Figure 2.
	+	For our result, run ``mwugan/synthetic_sine.py``
	+ 	For AdaGAN, run ``adagan/adagan_sine.py``
	+  	For EM and VAE, run corresponding script under ``others/``
-	``fashion/`` folder contained code needed to reproduce our Figure 3, 4 and 5 (to be uploaded)
- 	``additional/`` folder contained code needed to reproduce our Figure 7.
	+ 	For our result, run ``mwugan/synthetic_helix.py`` and ``mwugan/synthetic/outlier.py``
	+	For Adagan, run ``adagan/adagan_helix.py`` and ``adagan/adagan_outlier.py``
